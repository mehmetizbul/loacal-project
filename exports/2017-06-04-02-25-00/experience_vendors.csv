The institute is a non-profit organization which belongs to the Folk Arts Foundation. The aim of the institute is not only to produce, display and sell hand crafts using colors, patterns and motifs authentic to Cyprus, but also to give courses in handcrafts to revive this part of the Cyprus culture.

<img src=""http://www.hasder.org/Enstitu/Resimler/enstitu1.jpg"" alt="""" height=""218"" align=""left"" />Hand-made furniture and boxes, hand waived clothes, traditional costumes and baskets that occupy a unique place among traditional handcrafts are produced using traditional methods of Cyprus.

The institute is located in the historical site of Nicosia, Walled City, next to the Selimiye (Agia Sophia) Mosque and the restored building hosting the institute displays the beautiful characteristics of traditional British architecture. The institute has workshops and a showroom where handcrafts are produced and displayed.

Folk Arts Institute has attracted the attention of mass public, being a non-profit civil society organization which has succeeded to be economically self-sufficient since 2000. The institute is known as an organization that seeks to revive traditional handcrafting; a field that possesses importance and necessity for the island.
The organization is administrated by volunteers and within the body there are 8 professional personnel together with 17 housewives coming from rural settlements. With the aim of revitalizing handcrafting, vocational training courses have been given to approximately 500 people in the last three years.
Traditional production techniques are being used in the institute. Motifs, colors and figures kept alive for centuries are being used on merchandise being produced based on authentic traditional ones. The institute aims to produce commodities that could be used for both decorative purposes and for functions other than their initial uses.

Another field the institute emphasizes on is the production of souvenirs that reflect the local characteristics of the island. A great deal of effort is being put in to increase the variety of the production of these handmade miniature souvenirs which possess authentic colors and motifs"";s:5:""email"";s:0:"""";s:6:""admins"";s:2:""10"";s:10:""commission"";s:0:"""";s:15:""commission_type"";s:10:""percentage"";s:6:""paypal"";s:0:"""";s:15:""enable_bookings"";s:2:""no"";s:20:""per_product_shipping"";s:2:""no"";s:14:""instant_payout"";s:2:""no"";}"

<h3>Traditional Cyprus Cuisine</h3>
Food, too, reflects the divide: in the North you'll find mostly Turkish cuisine; in the Republic, Greek. But wherever you are in Cyprus , you'll come across kleftiko (oven-baked lamb), Greek in origin and mezedes (dips, salads and other appetizers). Cyprus is also famous for its fruit, which the government protects with a ban on imported products. You'll find strawberries, stone fruit, melons, prickly pear, citrus and grapes.

Cypriot cuisine has been influenced by different cultures throughout history. Each dish has a unique taste and is well presented reflecting the Cypriot character.
Molhiya, Arab in origin is a well developed dish appealing to Turkish Cypriot taste, preparation and presentation, since there were Arabs who passed it to Turks. A few traditional dishes: Yalanci Dolma (vine leaves stuffed with rice, onions, and tomatoes) is a Turkish Cypriot dish. In Turkish Yalanci Dolma means ""stuffed liar"". Derived from common dolma that is filled with meat, Yalanci means ""cheat/liar"" which signifies the meat is missing. You can encounter with Dolma and Sarma in Serbia, Croatia, Bulgaria and other Balkan countries of a former Ottoman Empire; Sish Kebab (marinated lamb, skewered and grilled over charcoal), shis is the everyday word used by Turkish people which refers to ""skewer"", similarly Doner Kebab means ""spinning kebab""; Musakka (layers of mince, potatoes, and aubergines baked in the oven with cheese topping), Greek in origin.
Many Cyprus dishes vary from region to region making Cyprus a fascinating place to eat.

The Turkish-Cypriot cuisine owes its heritage to a mixture of Mediterranean , Southern European and Middle Eastern influences. Local Cyprus dishes are delicious, particularly the meze . This is a specialty of Cyprus and consists of a large number of cold and hot hors d'oeuvres such as different salads, meats, vegetable, and fish dishes. It is taken either as an appetizer or a main course.

Among some interesting dishes that can be found in Cyprus belongs kolokas, a root vegetable which when cooked has a texture of potato, with sweet taste. What is extraordinary about this dish is that it is not of Turkish or Greek origin, but was brought to Cyprus Island by Venetians who came to Cyprus prior to Ottomans. Due to etymological meaning Colocasia esculenta means ""elephant's ears"", because that is what the leaves of plants look like. Kolokas is usually served with chicken or lamb.

The Turkish coffee has been introduced to the West by the Ottoman Turks in the fifteenth century. It is very popular all over the world today and is preferred as a delicacy in most fashionable circles. The secret of making Turkish coffee is that the coffee beans are ground into a fine powder and then it is cooked together with sugar producing a thick cream on top. Turkish coffee is served in small coffee cups, and in three ways, called sade , which is unsweetened, orta , which is moderately sweet, and sekerli , which is very sweet. One is always asked before the coffee is brewed which of the three one would like.

The coffee should be ground just before it is to be made, and it should be as fine as possible. Put one dessert-spoonful of the powder into a small pot with as much sugar as you like, and add one demi-tasse of boiling water. Allow the coffee to boil up and then immediately remove it from the heat. Repeat this process three times, and pour it into the coffee cup. The grains must be given time to subside in the cup before you can drink the coffee and it is helpful to stroke the froth in the cup gently as you wait. Turkish coffee is usually served with a glass of cold water, and it is the custom to take a sip of water after drinking coffee.

When the coffee is finished quite a lot of black sediment will be left in the bottom of the cup, and a favorite Turkish pastime it to tell fortunes in the grains. The ladies are especially good at this. You are asked to tip your cup upside down on the saucer, so that the grains can run down the sides of the cup forming patterns. After a suitable pause, the cup is scrutinized by the expert and your future is revealed. Some of the predictions are highly amusing, some sinister and ominous!

Cypriot cuisine includes a great variety of vegetable dishes, grills, pastry, fish, soups, lahmacun and many more.

In addition to local cuisine, Chinese, Italian, French and Indian foods are served in international restaurants.

Greek Cypriot cuisine derives from Greece mainland and its associated islands. Given the geography and history of Greece , this style of cookery has influences from Italian, Balkan and Middle Eastern cuisine. The terrain has tended to favour the production of goats and sheep over cattle, and thus beef dishes tend to be a rarity by comparison. Fish dishes are also common in Cyprus cuisine.

Olive oil produced from the trees prominent throughout the region, adds to the distinctive taste of Greek food. Many dishes use filo pastry. Too much refinement is generally considered to be against the hearty spirit of the Greek cuisine. Traditionally, Greek dishes are served warm rather than hot as eating food too hot was deemed unhealthy."";s:5:""email"";s:0:"""";s:6:""admins"";s:6:""52,176"";s:10:""commission"";s:0:"""";s:15:""commission_type"";s:10:""percentage"";s:6:""paypal"";s:0:"""";s:15:""enable_bookings"";s:2:""no"";s:20:""per_product_shipping"";s:2:""no"";s:14:""instant_payout"";s:2:""no"";s:7:""term_id"";i:226;s:4:""name"";s:13:""Green Kitchen"";s:4:""slug"";s:13:""green-kitchen"";s:10:""term_group"";i:0;s:16:""term_taxonomy_id"";i:226;s:8:""taxonomy"";s:20:""wcpv_product_vendors"";s:11:""description"";s:11:""yemek kursu"";s:6:""parent"";i:0;s:5:""count"";i:2;}"

<h3>Traditional Cyprus Cuisine</h3>
Food, too, reflects the divide: in the North you'll find mostly Turkish cuisine; in the Republic, Greek. But wherever you are in Cyprus , you'll come across kleftiko (oven-baked lamb), Greek in origin and mezedes (dips, salads and other appetizers). Cyprus is also famous for its fruit, which the government protects with a ban on imported products. You'll find strawberries, stone fruit, melons, prickly pear, citrus and grapes.

Cypriot cuisine has been influenced by different cultures throughout history. Each dish has a unique taste and is well presented reflecting the Cypriot character.
Molhiya, Arab in origin is a well developed dish appealing to Turkish Cypriot taste, preparation and presentation, since there were Arabs who passed it to Turks. A few traditional dishes: Yalanci Dolma (vine leaves stuffed with rice, onions, and tomatoes) is a Turkish Cypriot dish. In Turkish Yalanci Dolma means ""stuffed liar"". Derived from common dolma that is filled with meat, Yalanci means ""cheat/liar"" which signifies the meat is missing. You can encounter with Dolma and Sarma in Serbia, Croatia, Bulgaria and other Balkan countries of a former Ottoman Empire; Sish Kebab (marinated lamb, skewered and grilled over charcoal), shis is the everyday word used by Turkish people which refers to ""skewer"", similarly Doner Kebab means ""spinning kebab""; Musakka (layers of mince, potatoes, and aubergines baked in the oven with cheese topping), Greek in origin.
Many Cyprus dishes vary from region to region making Cyprus a fascinating place to eat.

The Turkish-Cypriot cuisine owes its heritage to a mixture of Mediterranean , Southern European and Middle Eastern influences. Local Cyprus dishes are delicious, particularly the meze . This is a specialty of Cyprus and consists of a large number of cold and hot hors d'oeuvres such as different salads, meats, vegetable, and fish dishes. It is taken either as an appetizer or a main course.

Among some interesting dishes that can be found in Cyprus belongs kolokas, a root vegetable which when cooked has a texture of potato, with sweet taste. What is extraordinary about this dish is that it is not of Turkish or Greek origin, but was brought to Cyprus Island by Venetians who came to Cyprus prior to Ottomans. Due to etymological meaning Colocasia esculenta means ""elephant's ears"", because that is what the leaves of plants look like. Kolokas is usually served with chicken or lamb.

The Turkish coffee has been introduced to the West by the Ottoman Turks in the fifteenth century. It is very popular all over the world today and is preferred as a delicacy in most fashionable circles. The secret of making Turkish coffee is that the coffee beans are ground into a fine powder and then it is cooked together with sugar producing a thick cream on top. Turkish coffee is served in small coffee cups, and in three ways, called sade , which is unsweetened, orta , which is moderately sweet, and sekerli , which is very sweet. One is always asked before the coffee is brewed which of the three one would like.

The coffee should be ground just before it is to be made, and it should be as fine as possible. Put one dessert-spoonful of the powder into a small pot with as much sugar as you like, and add one demi-tasse of boiling water. Allow the coffee to boil up and then immediately remove it from the heat. Repeat this process three times, and pour it into the coffee cup. The grains must be given time to subside in the cup before you can drink the coffee and it is helpful to stroke the froth in the cup gently as you wait. Turkish coffee is usually served with a glass of cold water, and it is the custom to take a sip of water after drinking coffee.

When the coffee is finished quite a lot of black sediment will be left in the bottom of the cup, and a favorite Turkish pastime it to tell fortunes in the grains. The ladies are especially good at this. You are asked to tip your cup upside down on the saucer, so that the grains can run down the sides of the cup forming patterns. After a suitable pause, the cup is scrutinized by the expert and your future is revealed. Some of the predictions are highly amusing, some sinister and ominous!

Cypriot cuisine includes a great variety of vegetable dishes, grills, pastry, fish, soups, lahmacun and many more.

In addition to local cuisine, Chinese, Italian, French and Indian foods are served in international restaurants.

Greek Cypriot cuisine derives from Greece mainland and its associated islands. Given the geography and history of Greece , this style of cookery has influences from Italian, Balkan and Middle Eastern cuisine. The terrain has tended to favour the production of goats and sheep over cattle, and thus beef dishes tend to be a rarity by comparison. Fish dishes are also common in Cyprus cuisine.

Olive oil produced from the trees prominent throughout the region, adds to the distinctive taste of Greek food. Many dishes use filo pastry. Too much refinement is generally considered to be against the hearty spirit of the Greek cuisine. Traditionally, Greek dishes are served warm rather than hot as eating food too hot was deemed unhealthy."";s:5:""email"";s:0:"""";s:6:""admins"";s:6:""52,176"";s:10:""commission"";s:0:"""";s:15:""commission_type"";s:10:""percentage"";s:6:""paypal"";s:0:"""";s:15:""enable_bookings"";s:2:""no"";s:20:""per_product_shipping"";s:2:""no"";s:14:""instant_payout"";s:2:""no"";s:7:""term_id"";i:226;s:4:""name"";s:13:""Green Kitchen"";s:4:""slug"";s:13:""green-kitchen"";s:10:""term_group"";i:0;s:16:""term_taxonomy_id"";i:226;s:8:""taxonomy"";s:20:""wcpv_product_vendors"";s:11:""description"";s:11:""yemek kursu"";s:6:""parent"";i:0;s:5:""count"";i:2;}"
