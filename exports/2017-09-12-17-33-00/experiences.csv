"416","10","Karpaz Weaving Workshop","We as Hasder Folk Arts Institute, are a non-profit organization. We do not only produce, display and sell hand crafts using colors, patterns and motifs authentic to Cyprus, but also give courses in handcrafts to revive this part of the Cyprus culture.

Our goal is to revive the past, to promote and cherish the old products in Cyprus. With this course, you will how to weave, like the old days. You use the weaving loom, winding it around a spinning wheel and experience how we make chest covers, trestle covers, curtains, and various products.

We start our workshop with weaving on our shuttle loom, then switch our foot below. Then, we press what we call ""comb"", the mechanism. With the help of this comb, we press our yarns while we keep switching our foot.  Now, with this workshop, you will learn the basic of Karpaz weaving, what's making it different from normal weaving and actually experience how to do it and make a small piece with you own hands.

We believe weaving brings a great sense of fulfillment to those engaged in the craft. It is very enjoyable.

<strong>For many cultures, weaving is a family tradition that is passed from mother to daughter</strong>. The link to future generations creates an invisible tie that connects people with their heritage. As we says, your culture is your roots, you know where you came from, what you are. So, lets go deep into Cypriot roots and find the hidden treasures of Cypriot culture, coming over years and years.

<strong>Now, join our 1-1.5 hours workshop and experience Cypriot culture!</strong>

You can take the pieces you make. You will need to pay for the raw material (cloth) by cash on the of the experience. The charges vary from 1 to 3 euros each.

<strong>What can you make with wood?</strong>
Literally anything: Ornaments, table for walls, key rings, boxes, trays, decoration and many more...

Thanks for reading. We are looking forward to meeting with you!","publish","karpaz-weaving-workshop","291","2016-03-18 14:01:32","2016-11-01 07:17:40"

<p style=""text-align: left;"">Do you know that since the fall of the Berlin Wall, only one capital city in the world remains divided in two: Nicosia (Lefkosa). This daytime city is best experienced by staying until dusk, when the minarets light up and release their evening call to prayer and the air is scented with an intoxicating combination of wild jasmine and freshly grilled kebabs.</p>
<strong>What will you see in this historic city?</strong>
I can pick up and drop off to your hotel in Nicosia by my car, or we may start the tour at a pre-defined location depending on preference. It does not matter if you are on the southern or northern part of the city, we will cross the border during our tour. Please be aware that when passing the border (Green Line), you will need to present your passport/ ID card. I highly suggest you check whether your ID is accepted by both sides. You can always send a message to me and ask for further information.

Nicosia lies roughly at the center of Cyprus, with a rich history that can be traced back to the Bronze Age. During our tour, we will focus on the heart of the city, enclosed by 16th-century Venetian walls.

Places we will see in
<strong>Southern Nicosia</strong>
The walking tour aims to give an overall picture of the city within the Venetian Walls and how it has evolved through the centuries. We will stroll around Ledra’s Street, the most prominent shopping area in Nicosia, mainly dominated by large department stores, flavoured with smaller boutiques and traditional tastes. You will have the chance to walk through the town's architecture from the medieval years to the present and to some of its churches.

<strong>Northern Nicosia</strong>
Main attractions we will visit at Northern Nicosia is car-free old town within the Venetian Walls. We shall see Bandabuliya (indoor market consists of local shops), St. Sophia Cathedral (Selimiye Mosque), Bedesten (St Nicholas Church of the English), Arasta (pedestrian market area) on our walk. We can then enjoy Cypriot coffee at a traditional coffee shop or traditional Cypriot lunch at the Great Inn (Buyuk Han) depending on the time of the day. You will also have the opportunity to visit Hasder (non-profit organisation) to shop the handcrafts and laces of Cyprus which has variety of souvenirs for a reasonable price to take home with you. They do have a number workshops on creating traditional handcrafts for the travelers interested. Please check their Loacal profile for further details.
I would love to show you further around, taking you to Kyrenia Gate, Atatürk Square (Sarayonu) and further around but this will be limited to the time spent on previous locations.

I first met with Yoga about 6 years ago. I felt extremely connected to the flow and it was great. Since then, Yoga has become my life long journey. A journey of discovering myself, my breath, my body, my emotions, my balance and my fears. When I'm practicing Yoga and I get totally connected to the flow, the moves become the flow. Throughout the years that I have practiced Yoga, I have attended different workshops and many seminars with different teachers. I also attended workshops in India. In December 2015, I have completed a 200 hours vinyasa yoga teacher training course. I love practicing and teaching yoga. As being an outdoor person, i love teaching in nature too.

My passion is the countryside and wild life that surrounds Fethiye, its mountains, forests, birds, flowers and coastal wetlands – and of course the sea turtles. I have a watching point at Fethiye, Calis Beach that is an ideal spot to study and care for the Carretta Carretta sea turtles which nest on the beaches here. Caretta Caretta are officially on the endangered list and slowly, slowly, there’s more awareness about protecting them in this area of Turkey.

It worth to mention that sea turtles have been around for up to 110 million years, visiting Fethiye's beaches to lay their eggs from May to July; long before humans were around. For the last 20 summers research teams from various Turkish and European universities have also been appearing on Fethiye's beaches every May.

<strong>How will we spend the days?</strong>
You will be provided information between 9-11pm and will be protecting and caring the Carretta Carrettas until 4am.
Day time is much relaxed. There will be general control between the eggs at beach if needed. Otherwise, resting at hammocks will be your biggest activity :)

<strong>Accommodation</strong>
As a volunteer you might camp close-by or stay at a shared house. Breakfast is on your budget but a huge dinner will be provided.

<strong>Languages</strong>
I can speak Turkish and English fluently with very limited German.

<strong>Fee</strong>
We are a volunteering project so do not ask fee. However, whatever you hand in will be used for Carretta Carrettas.

Turkish:
Radio Pangea, kültürel çatışmalara, farklılıklar arasında hor görmelere karşı, birlikteliği ve anlayışı sağlamada en etkili yolun müzik olduğu görüşünü benimsiyor. “Müzik Dünyayı Birleştirir” sloganıyla yola çıkan Radio Pangea, dj-seti ile sizi Ortadoğu ritimlerinden Jazz’a, Drum’n Bass’den Balkan havalarına, Ska’dan Anadolu tınılarına, Tango’dan Funk’a, Rumba’dan Reggae’ye, Swing’ten Hiphop’a, Çingene müziğinden Rock’n Roll’a kadar uzanan çok kültürlü bir eğlence deneyimine davet ediyor.

Radio Pangea dans partilerinde DJ setup'ta Barçın Gökbörü oluyor. Dünyanın her yerinden müziklerin bulunduğu çok geniş bir müzik arşivine sahip Barçın Gökbörü, 2001-2012 yılları arasında Araf Bar, Melek Bar, Nayah, Baraka, Leb-i Derya, 5. Kat, Haymatlos, Arsen Lüpen gibi Beyoğlu'nun önemli eğlence mekanlarında performans sergilemiş, bu mekanların Avrupa'da da ün yapmasına müziği ile önemli katkıda bulunmuş, üzerinden yıllar geçse de kolay kolay unutulmayacak birçok geceye imzasını atmıştır. Baba Zula, Gevende, Luxus, Erkan Oğur, Bulent Ortaçgil, Bajar, Hakan Vreskala, Birsen Tezer, Siya Siyabend gibi Türkiye'nin önemli müzisyenleri ile beraber çaldı. Kitleyi salt eğlendirme üzerine değil, müziğin içindeki kültürü yaşatarak eğlendirmeyi kendine amaç edinmesi onu dans DJ'lerinden farklılaştıran unsurlardan biridir.

Greek:
Ο Radio Pangea πιστεύει ότι ο πιο αποτελεσματικός τρόπος για την καταπολέμηση της πολιτισμικής σύγκρουσης και των περιφρονητικών συμπεριφορών απέναντι στις διαφορές μας, έγκειται στη μουσική. Η μουσική ενώνει και γεφυρώνει τις διαφορετικές κουλτούρες. Ο Radio Pangea προτείνει μια διαπολιτισμική ψυχαγωγική εμπειρία με ρυθμούς Μέσης Ανατολής, Jazz, Drum' n Bass', ήχους από την Ανατολή και τα Βαλκάνια, Ταγκό, Funk και Ρούμπα, Reggae, Swing, Hiphop, gypsy μουσική και ροκ εν ρολ.","draft",,"17","2016-06-09 08:36:35","2016-06-09 08:36:35"

"2029","3","Meet with Cleopatra's Secret Soup-Molehiya","Mulukhiyah, molokhia, molohiya is the leaves of Corchorus Olitorius<i>,</i> commonly known as Nalta jute or Jew's mallow. Molehiya is a traditional food in Cyprus and it takes up to 2 moths to grow up and be ready for harvest. After harvest local people get together and separate the leaves from the stems.

<strong>What we offer in this experience?
</strong>I will pick you up from Nicosia to go fields for harvesting early in the morning. Afterwards we harvested the Molehiya we will return back to nicosia to my offices. There we will separate leaves from the stems for cooking. We also offer you to cook together and have a lunch together.
There is two options for cooking the Molohiya. One is fresh and other one is dried leaves. Cooked in a tomato based broth with onions and garlic. Lamb on the bone or Chicken with bone may also be added. For optimal results lemon and potato are also used to help keep the consistency from becoming too mucilaginous or slimy. It is served with a nice broth consistency with sour dough bread.
<h2><span id=""Nutrition"" class=""mw-headline"">Nutrition</span></h2>
The leaves are rich in betacarotene, iron, calcium, Vitamin C and more than 32 vitamins, minerals and trace elements. The plant has a potent antioxidantactivity with a significant α-tocopherol equivalent Vitamin E.

According to some internet sources, molokhiya means vegetable for King. <strong>During 6000 BC</strong>, a sick Egyptian King asked a bowl of hot soup, and found it tasty. After taking hot soup every day, the King's illness was healed. <strong>Cleopatra </strong>also enjoyed the same soup. The soup was the Egyptian spinach called molokhiya. We believe that this miracle vegetable originated in India and Egypt.

Molokhiya is known as the king of vegetables. Its carotene contents are 4.6 times more than spinach, which Popeye loved, and 19 times more than broccoli. Its calcium contents are 9 times more than spinach and 10 times more than broccoli. Even vitamins B1 and B2 are five times more compared to spinach. It contains much more Vitamin E, C, potassium, iron, and other vegetable fibers than any other vegetables.

First of all, as part of this tour you will <strong>experience Cyprus life</strong>, from local clothes &amp; dresses to a traditional meal. History of the village &amp; Cyprus, old houses, handcrafts and every other cultural details are preserved as in history. Please read below to see what we will cover and feel free to contact us if you have any question or request.

Kalavac Village, holding a tourism certification, hosts numbers of <strong>old houses and authentic buildings</strong> which have been renovated with the support of European Union. Originals of the remaining <strong>buildings from 1700s</strong> are still preserved with great care.

If you wonder how was the <strong>Cyprus culture and traditions</strong> in the past, this experience is just for you! Here, Cyprus culture and traditions are preserved very well. Local people still wear <strong>traditional clothes</strong> such as şalvar (trousers), Yemeni (headscarf), etc., and use old fashioned doors with no lock and cots (old style beds) in their daily life, as in the past.

This experience mostly focused on historical places and old items. <strong>300-years-old shoe </strong>is one of the most interesting pieces. During this experience, we are going to visit <strong>800-years-old olive tree, 400-500-years-old hand mill, 400-years-old clay bee hives</strong> and a plough which was used to plow in former times. Additionally, <strong>Museum of Traditional Cyprus Villages</strong> will be visited.

While visiting a very famous place at land, known as <strong>Cinlerin Sofrasi</strong>, if we lucky enough, our path might come across with wild animals such as donkey or goat, in their natural habitats. Legends and stories about the places will be told during our visits. A famous legend <strong>Gagguvak Legend</strong> is only one of them.

<strong>Traditional rugs and baskets,</strong> made from wheat-ear, are also symbols of Cyprus culture. Our diligent Aunt Ayşe (look at the pictures, you might recognize her :) ) will be knitting an example for us. If you are interested, you can buy them at a reasonable price at the end of the experience. Furthermore, a local person will make<strong> handmade pasta and halloumi</strong> (min. 2 person) as part of this experience. We will have the opportunity to take pictures and ask questions.

While approaching to the end of our tour, it is time to taste some food which is unique to Cyprus! We will have 3 different lunch options. All the dishes will be cooked right in front of you, so you will be able to see the cooking procedure and capture the moment as a memory. If you are interested, you may also help us while cooking. A new recipe is always handy.

At the end of our experience, if you want you can <strong>eat traditional dishes</strong>. There are 3 different options;
<ol>
	<li>Traditional pastries of the village (bulla with hellim and olive and various traditional scones)</li>
	<li>Bidda Badadez (local Cyprus potatoes cooked with a mysterious recipe)</li>
	<li>Kleftiko (yogurt, salad and a soft drink included) (min. 20 person)</li>
</ol>
Note: You can choose either traditional pastries or bidda badadez which are included in the experience price. If you want to try Kleftiko, there will be a small amount of additional cost.

Also, after our meal, we will provide traditional desserts. You should, definitely, <strong>try walnut macun or turunc (orange) macun</strong>. If the season is summer, you can also try a delicious fruit known as <strong>babutsa</strong>, know as the cactus fig.

Turizm belgeli ve Avrupa Birliği desteği ile restore edilmiş köyümüzde genellikle eski evler ve otantik binalar bulunmaktadır. <strong>1700 yılından</strong> kalan binaların orijinalleri hala büyük bir özenle korunmaktadır.

Eskiden Kıbrıs gelenekleri ve kültürü nasıldı diye merak ediyorsanız, Kalavaç turu tam sizin içindir. Burada Kıbrıs gelenekleri ve kültürü çok iyi bir şekilde korunmuştur. Hala daha şalvar, yemeni (Kıbrıs’a has başörtüsü), ve benzeri <strong>yöresel kıyafetler</strong> giyiliyor. Köy insanları hala daha, eskiden olduğu gibi, kilitsiz ev kapılarını ve karyolaları (yatak) günlük hayatlarında kullanıyorlar.

Turumuzda çoğunlukla tarihi yerlere ve eski eşyalara yer verilmiştir. <strong>300 yıllık ayakkabı</strong> en çok ilgi gören parçalardan bir tanesidir. Deneyimimizde <strong>800 yaşındaki zeytin ağacına</strong>, <strong>400-500 senelik el değirmenine, 400 yıllık toprak arı kovanlarına ve </strong>eski zamanlarda tarla sürmek için kullanılan<strong> sabana </strong>yer verilmiştir. Ek olarak, <strong>yerel değerler müzesi </strong>gezilecektir.

<strong> Cinlerin Sofrası </strong>olarak bilinen mekânı ziyaret ederken, şanslıysak eşek, keçi gibi yaban hayvanlarını da doğal ortamlarında gözlemleyebiliriz. Gezilecek olan birçok yer efsanesi ve hikâyesiyle birlikte anlatılacaktır. Çok ünlü bir efsane olan <strong>Gagguvak Efsanesi</strong> de bunlardan biridir.

Yine Kıbrıs kültürünün olmazsa olmazı dediğimiz <strong>kilim, sele ve sepet</strong> gibi el emeği işlerini Ayşe Teyze dokurken canlı olarak izleyebileceksiniz. İlgilenirseniz, deneyimin sonunda uygun fiyata satın alabilirsiniz. Dahası, <strong>el makarnası </strong>ve <strong>köy hellimi </strong>(en az 2 kişi) yapımını da deneyimleyebilirsiniz.

Turumuzun sonuna doğru yaklaşırken <strong>yöresel, Kıbrıs’a özgü lezzetleri</strong> tatma vakti! Buralara kadar gelip <strong>ceviz, turunç veya benzeri macunları </strong>tatmadan geri dönmek olmaz. Dönemine göre bu tatların arasına çok lezzetli bir meyve olan <strong>babutsayı</strong> da ekleyebiliriz.

İsteğe göre yöresel yemekler yiyebilirsiniz. Bunun için 3 farklı seçeneğimiz mevcuttur.
<ol>
	<li>Köye özgü <strong>pilavuna </strong>(kuru üzümlü &amp; kaymak yağlı), hellimli ve zeytinli bulla</li>
	<li>Bidda Badadez</li>
	<li>Fırın Kebabı (yoğurt, salata ve içecek dâhil)(en az 20 kişi)</li>
</ol>
Yöresel yemekler hazırlanırken gözlemleyebilirsiniz. Eğer istiyorsanız, kişi sayısına bağlı olarak, siz de yardımcı olabilirsiniz.

After carefully removing the silkworm in them, the holeless cocoon was used in either picture works or in decorating dresses. You will learn how to shape them and together we will improve our handcrafting.
And don't worry at all on your creativeness. When I started, I was so stressed on how to do it; but from the first day, I noticed how joyful it is. I noticed that every person has their own style of doing things and silkworms are entertaining to play with.

All equipment will be provided.<strong> Just bring your passion to learn and enjoy!</strong>

Session is around 1-2 hrs. We offer longer term courses. Let us know in advance if you are interested.

I have <strong>5 years professional experience</strong> on cocoon and all other other courses we provide. We are working as two retired (and fun! :) ) ladies and love our new hobby.

Worth noting, my English is limited; timing will also depend on my friend who will do the translation.

We are located in the center of <strong>Kyrenia</strong>, just by the Kyernia Harbour. The gallery has an amazing sea view.

Slacklines are tensioned less than tightropes in order to create a dynamic line which will stretch and bounce like a long, narrow trampoline. However, the tension can be adjusted to suit the user, especially for people trying out to balance for the very first time. It is all about balance and staying focused, while having fun outdoors at the same time.
&nbsp;

What I am offering here through this ""loacal"" experience, is actually the chance for everyone interested to try out slacklining, learn how to safely set up the line, the basics of walking, turning and static tricks while on the line. The experiences take place in downtown Limassol. The gear used is a 2inch/5cm width Gibbon slackline kit that can be adjusted to a maximum length of 13meters.","publish","slacklining-discover-balance","60","2016-10-05 08:49:21","2016-10-05 08:49:21"

As part of this experience, you will meet with Sevcan Cerkez, visit her house that is full of her sculptures in the middle of Cyprus's untouched nature and depending on what she is working on, watch demonstrations.

<img class=""wp-image-3057 size-full aligncenter"" src=""http://loacal.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/IMG_8100.jpg"" alt=""img_8100"" width=""1324"" height=""883"" />

Her way of imaginative and colorful life view can be seen from the decoration of her house and her works.

There will be a mini-workshop offering an opportunity for anyone to create a unique and highly personal small piece of sculpture that can be taken back to home. The workshops are open to anyone and are tailored to suit all abilities. <strong>No sculpture experience is required.</strong> You will be amazed at just how creative you can be when applying 3-dimensional ceramic design and construction… and it’s great fun too!

Please note, all materials and use of tools are included in the price. We offer discounts to each additional person. Have a look at the pricing by the calendar.

Now, let's introduce our artist: Sevcan was born in Cyprus just before the the 1963 war in Cyprus when she was wandering around among the tents prepared for the immigrants, looking at people in astonishment. She names that moment when the facial expressions of people penetrated into our souls for the first time.

<img class=""wp-image-3008 size-full aligncenter"" src=""http://loacal.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/a16.jpg"" alt=""a16"" width=""400"" height=""600"" />

Throughout her life, she joined many group exhibitions and had solo painting exhibitions, draw caricatures issued in the local Yeni Düzen newspaper, joined many caricature exhibitions both in Cyprus and in overseas countries.

Her interest in the three dimensional art grew and in 2000 she met with ceramics. From the moment she took mud in her hands, she started making sculptures. She carried her caricature experience to her ceramics. She started with sculptures of about ten centimeters that were hollow inside and gradually increased the size to match the real human dimensions. And now, for more than 10 years, she has been making her large sculptures in the workshop in her house.

Her goal is to immortalize the Cypriot human mimics and characters that wars and other external forces couldn't destroy and to remind and share these values with people with her somewhat sorrow heart. She want to reflect problems of Cyprus and her love for nature and humanity with her ceramics, all of which shaped her soul like a handful of mud since childhood.

In addition to her interest in ceramics, she is interested in many parts of art, including singing at a local music band as a guest.

<b>Myra</b>: Some of the finest examples of Lycian funerary architecture are to be found at Myra, where the small town of Demre is situated today.

<b>Kekova</b>: Kekova, meaning home of the sun, is the name of picturesque islands, numerous bays and ancient cities. In fact, cruising yachts often anchor here for several weeks at a time.  It is a peaceful place of history, gorgeous turquoise water, sun, islands, unspoilt nature, blue skies and wonderful swimming.

"3523","3","Pamukkale & Hierapolis 2 Day Tour from Alanya","Looking for experiencing the magic of Pamukkale and the grandeur of Hierapolis on a comprehensive<strong> 2-day coach tour from Alanya</strong>, including overnight accommodation, breakfast and dinner, you are at the right place.

Pamukkale, literally meaning “<strong>Cotton Castle</strong>” combines <em>natural beauty</em> and <em>history</em> in one place. It will be easy to understand why Turkish named like this when you see the steeply terraced hillside with its bright, white covering.

Being a UNESCO World Heritage Site and hosting many travertine, Pamukkale is also famous for wellness travelers. There you will see the thermal spring water laden with calcareous salt, plunging down the mountain side which has created this natural formation of stalactites, cataracts and basins. The thermal water has been used since the Roman period for its therapeutic powers.
<h3><strong>Day 1</strong></h3>
In the early morning you will be picked up free of charge from your hotel and before driving to Pamukkale, we will stop in Korkuteli to have breakfast (breakfast not included in price). Here, you will also have the opportunity to buy some snacks and tea/ coffee. On the way to Pamukkale we will stop at Denizli, the closest city to Pamukkale, to make the long journey more easy and comfortable and to enjoy the beautiful panoramic view. Here we will have a lunch break, that you can either sit with the tour guide and enjoy the open buffet menu or the lunch boxes  you have brought. (lunch not included in price).

On arrival, We will amazed with the ruins of the ancient spa city of <strong>Hierapolis</strong> based on the top of this white castle and the dream-like white travertines. Many of these milk-white natural pools are deep enough for swimming, and because of the warm climate and thermally-heated water, there’s no chance of a chill, even if you visit in the off-peak season!

While wondering around this geological miracle, you will also learn more about the history and culture of this area and see amphitheater, city walls, bathhouses, necropolis and more.

We will of course visit Cleopatra’s Pool, also called the <strong>Sacred Pool </strong>and Pamukkale Antique Pool, which is area’s one of biggest biggest draws. According to legend, this artificially sculpted pool was a gift from Marc Anthony to Cleopatra and is <em>rumoured</em> to have swum here. Swimming there is optional and for an extra charge.

Our next stop will be hotel where we will have our dinner and store energy and enthusiasm for the next day.
<h3><strong>Day 2</strong></h3>
After having an open buffet breakfast in the hotel, we will take our belongings with us and start our journey to natural hot thermal springs near Karahayit town named Kirmizi Su which translates to red water. You will be delighted to see these<strong> red travertines</strong>. You will have the option to swim there and enjoy bubbling from beneath the calcite rocks - very rich in calcium, magnesium and sulphurs, at about 56 degrees for an extra charge!

Our next stops are more on meeting with habits of the local, such as visiting a mosque to learn more about the religious traditions of local people or shopping at leather shop.

Our return journey will sadly start after this point, passing from Denizli for lunch and then back to your hotels.

"4092","3","Wonders of Cappadocia: Hiking and Underground City Tour","Uncover the ancient Cappadocia during this full-day tour! Hiking through spectacular <strong>Red Valley</strong>, exploring the colourful and breath-taking fairy chimneys and the structures left centuries ago by the village’s former Greek inhabitants, gazing over the cliff-carved birdhouses of <strong>Pigeon Valley</strong> and touring over the subterranean network of <strong>Kaymakli Underground City</strong>, i.e. Cappadocia Valley Hiking and Underground City Tour, is a must-do activity for Cappadocia travellers.

The tour starts with your pick-up from the hotel in the morning, and continues to our first stop, <strong>Red Valley,</strong> a stunning area of red, rose, yellow, orange- and multi-colored rock cones, peaks and cliffs. Immerse yourself in the local flora and fauna in the Red Valley! Your 4 km hike with an informative guide along the breath-taking Red Valley, orchards and some cave houses will end at the deserted<strong> old Greek village</strong> <strong>Cavusin</strong> where you will see famous rock cut ancient churches, castle and cave dwellings. You will walk up the hill to visit rock cut churches and on your way <strong>learn about the history of caves and shelters</strong> and the people who once called them home, and why they left centuries ago.

Then, you will stop at a nice local restaurant for a delicious lunch (included in the price). From here your way is to Kaymakli (Enegup in Greek) Underground City, built under the hill known as the Citadel of Kaymakli. <strong>Kaymakli Underground City</strong> is one of the best preserved of its kind in Cappadocia. It was opened to visitors in 1964 and consists of 8 levels (only 4 are open). Heading towards underground will surprise you with its around <strong>nearly</strong> <strong>one hundred tunnels</strong>. The inhabitants of the region still use the most convenient pasts on the tunnel they access through their courtyards as cellars, storage areas and stables.

You will then pass through <strong>Pigeon Valley</strong> where you will be see amazing examples of pale pink and cream rock formations, dotted with caves and the pigeon houses that give the valley its name.

End your day with a stop at the <strong>Ortahisar Rock Castle</strong>, <strong>the biggest fairy chimney of Cappadocia</strong>. At the outskirts of the castle there are available the samples of the civil architecture characteristic to Cappadocia. The overview is magnificent. These ancient valley cave homes are looking like a truly fairy tail town with a huge rock towering over it.

<h2 style=""text-align: center;"">World's last divided city : Nicosia</h2>
<p style=""text-align: left;"">Do you know that since the fall of the Berlin Wall, only one capital city in the world remains divided in two: Nicosia (Lefkosa). There is a slim ""Green Line"" controlled by UN that is a buffer zone that snakes through Nicosia, keeping the North and South of Nicosia apart. Well, let's be honest, the border is more of a formality here now.</p>
<p style=""text-align: left;"">So, <strong>what I am offering?</strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: left;"">Tour of Nicosia! The best way to explore around old city is walking, as it's relatively small enough to navigate on foot.</p>
<b>Things to Note</b>
It does not matter if you are on the southern or northern part of the city, we will cross the border during our tour. Please be aware that when passing the border (Green Line), you will need to present your <strong>passport/ ID card</strong>. I highly suggest you check whether your ID is accepted by both sides. You can always send a message to me and ask for further information.

As part of this tour, we may stop at a traditional coffee shop or for traditional Cypriot lunch. You just need to ask that day.

You may also purchase the handcrafts and laces of Cyprus which has variety of souvenirs at Hasder (a non-profit organisation).

<strong>What will you see in this historic city?</strong>

Our tour is customizable, i.e. it's mostly dependent on you!

<strong>My suggestion attractions in Northern Nicosia</strong>
<ul>
	<li>Car-free old town within the Venetian Walls.</li>
	<li>Bandabuliya (indoor market consists of local shops)</li>
	<li>St. Sophia Cathedral (Selimiye Mosque)</li>
	<li>Bedesten (St Nicholas Church of the English)</li>
	<li>Arasta (pedestrian market area) on our walk.</li>
	<li>the Great Inn (Buyuk Han)</li>
	<li>Kyrenia Gate</li>
	<li>Atatürk Square (Sarayonu) ...</li>
</ul>
I am unfortunately not an expert on<strong> Southern Nicosia</strong>. However, we may walk through the main attractions in Southern old Nicosia and stroll around Ledra’s Street, the most prominent shopping area in Nicosia,

If you have any question, please do not hesitate to contact me. I will customise the tours when requested, feel free to ask for additional location visits and specific requests.

Next to it, the only <strong>ghost city</strong> of the entire region which <strong>no one has ever lived since 43 years</strong>. You may ask why is that? Its absolutely political but nobody knows the correct answer. On the edges of this ghost-city, there are  half-ghost neighborhoods where residents mainly has agricultural jobs. But on the other side of the city with the effect of its international university, there is a completely different life than other parts of the city. Sounds too diverse right? All of those happen in a small city in the eastern side of Cyprus. I am inviting you to explore this city with me.

I am offering a daily-tour to Famagusta, which may include exploring the old-city through walking to main attractions, because that is the only way to get the feeling of city as it is very small but very rich place in terms of cultural heritage. You will have plenty of opportunity to make photos of this beautiful place. As part of this we may have a coffee at a coffee-shop or a cypriot-lunch according to your request. You can also buy traditional souvenirs in one of shops if you wish. Our tour is <strong>customizable to you</strong>.

My top suggestions for attractions in Famagusta- Old City are Lala Mustafa Pasha Mosque (St.Nicholas Cathedral), Othello Castle, Namık Kemal Square, Namık Kemal Dungeon &amp; Museum and  Porta del Mare (Sea Gate). How much we cover those attractions are up to your expectations. After the old city we may continue to Palm beach area which is the only beach inside city, where you can observe ghost-city, takes photos and may be swim depending on the season. Additionally that area has good scenery of port and castle. After that we can make a small <strong>car-tour to see a general picture of the ghost city</strong>. Finally we can have a look to the last part of the city which includes the university where most of the cafe's- bars and shopping centres are located.

"4980","3","Discover Scuba Diving Experience","Let's try scuba diving in Oludeniz!

See for yourself what scuba diving is all about! Try a Discover Scuba Diving experience. Have you ever wondered what it’s like to breathe underwater? If you want to find out but aren’t quite ready to take the plunge into a certification course, Discover Scuba Diving will let you try scuba to see if you like it. We offer this program, either in a pool or in confined water. You might try it with us while you’re on vacation.

While not an actual scuba certification, during the Discover Scuba Diving experience you’ll learn how to use scuba equipment in shallow water and get a quick and easy introduction to what it takes to explore the underwater world. Having conducted DSD program with us qualifies you to dive with us during your holiday. It is a limited certification, limited to us and this holiday.

<strong>The Fun Part</strong>
There is nothing like breathing underwater for the very first time. It takes a little getting used to –after all, human beings weren’t designed to do that – but after a few minutes of awestruck wonder, most participants realise how easy scuba diving really is. The biggest challenge instructors have with the Discover Scuba Diving program is not coaxing participants into the water, but coaxing them out when the program is over. The fun part? It’s all fun!
<ul>
	<li>Plus, you can get credit! If your Discover Scuba Diving program includes an actual scuba dive in open water, your experience may count toward <a href=""https://loacal.com/experience/padi-scuba-diver-course/"">PADI Scuba Diver</a> or <a href=""https://loacal.com/experience/open-water-diver-3-days/"">Open Water Diver certification</a>, putting you a step ahead of the game when you decide to go for it.</li>
</ul>
<strong>What You Learn</strong>
You learn the basics you need to dive under the direct supervision of a PADI Professional. One thing you’ll learn is that you really can breathe underwater and whether you like doing that or not.

<strong>You will:</strong>
<ul>
	<li>Find out what it’s like to breathe underwater and learn whether you can be comfortable there</li>
	<li>See some marine life</li>
	<li>Learn some basic skills and safety rules that will carry over to your full scuba certification course when you take the next step</li>
</ul>
<strong>The Scuba Gear You Use</strong>
All the equipment you will need is included in your Discover Scuba Diving experience. You’ll use all the basic scuba gear including a mask and fins, a buoyancy compensating jacket (BCD) that also carries your scuba tank, a scuba regulator to breathe from and instrumentation to monitor your air supply. You might also wear a scuba wetsuit and a weight system depending on when you do your Discover Scuba Diving program with us.

<strong>Prerequisites</strong>
To take Discover Scuba Diving, you must be at least 10 years old

Short on time and long on the urge to become a certified diver? The PADI Scuba Diver certification might just be for you. This course requires less time than the PADI Open Water Diver course, covering only the first three of five sections of knowledge development, the first three of five pool sessions, and the first two of four open water training dives, resulting in a limited certification. Particularly if you expect to go scuba diving primarily in the company of a dive guide or if you have limited time to devote to scuba certification, consider becoming a PADI Scuba Diver.

This certification allows for ample dive experience and is a good warm-up for the Open Water Diver course if that’s your ultimate goal. PADI Scuba Divers are qualified to:
<ul>
	<li>Dive under the direct supervision of a PADI Divemaster, Assistant Instructor or Instructor to a maximum depth of 12 metres / 40 feet</li>
	<li>Obtain air fills, rent or purchase scuba equipment and participate in other diving activities as long as they have the required supervision</li>

<ul>
	<li>Complete your <a href=""https://loacal.com/experience/open-water-diver-3-days/"">Open Water Diver</a> whenever you want! Take your Scuba Diver certification to Open Water Diver with a few additional dives and knowledge development, and make the jump to Open Water Diver certification. You can start scuba diving independently whenever time allows or you’re up for more</li>
</ul>
<strong>What You Learn</strong>
All the basics of scuba diving through knowledge development, a set of scuba skills in the pool that you’ll use again during open water dives, and an appreciation for the underwater world that will keep you coming back for more bottom time every chance you get!

During the course, you’ll cover material and practice skills related to topics such as:
<ul>
	<li>Buoyancy skills including comfortable ascents and descents, and breathing underwater.</li>
	<li>Staying warm underwater, streamlining your swimming skills and buddy diving techniques.</li>
	<li>Diving environments and aquatic life you’re likely to encounter.</li>
	<li>Preventing common problems underwater.</li>
</ul>
<strong>The Scuba Gear You Use</strong>
You’ll use all the basic scuba gear and some of it may be included with your course. You may want to invest in your own mask, snorkel and fins since these personal items are a lot more fun to use when they fit properly. A buoyancy compensating jacket that holds your scuba tank, a scuba regulator that delivers air, a weight system and instrumentation to monitor depth and air supply will also be used. You will also wear a wetsuit.

<strong>The Prerequisites for This Course</strong>
To take this course, you must be:
<ul>
	<li>10 years old (10-14 years old earn Junior Scuba Diver certification)</li>

What a wonderful  leader its leader shall be, and what a wonderful army that army will be!” (Musnad Ahmad).</p>
Istanbul is the center of religion for centuries. After the ottoman period Islamic Religion spreaded througout the city. The first mosque in Istanbul was built in Kadikoy on the Asian side of the city, which was conquered by the Ottoman Turks in 1353.

The first mosque on the European side of Istanbul was built inside the Rumeli Castle in 1452. The first grand mosque which was built in the city proper is the Eyup Sultan Mosque (1458), while the first imperial mosque inside the city walls was the Fatih Mosque (1470) which was built on the site of the Church of the Holy Apostles, an important Byzantine church which was originally edificed in the time of Constantine the Great.

Many other imperial mosques were built in the following centuries, such as the famous Suleymaniye Mosque (1557) which was ordered by Suleiman the Magnificent and designed by the great Ottoman architect Sinan, and the famous Sultan Ahmet Mosque (1616) which is also known as the Blue Mosque for the blue tiles which adorn its interior. Istanbul was the final seat of the Islamic Caliphate, between 1517 and 1924.

The personal belongings of Mohammed and the earliest Caliphs who followed him are today preserved in the Topkapı Palace, the Eyup Sultan Mosque and in several other prominent mosques of Istanbul.

I should say - all under one roof, and cut up into innumerable little blocks by narrow streets which are arched overhead.”

With more than <strong>4000 shops in 64 streets and with 22 gates</strong>, the-Grand Bazaar - or Kapalıçarsı as it is in Turkish - , looks like a labyrinth. We must say that this definitely is not a shopping tour - but a walk that will leads you through shops where they sell leather goods, sweets, dried fruit and spices, jewellery, glassware, pottery, fabrics, belly dancing costumes, t-shirts and all sorts of souvenirs.

We will visit <strong>workshops</strong> where you will see <strong>how gold is melt in fire</strong>, as it has been for centuries; you will witness how the craftsmen fix degrees on carats; you will see how artisans do their engraving on silver.

The program starts every evening at 7.30 pm (except Tuesdays and Thursdays). Please be there 30 minutes before the show starts.

The performance of Sufis (or semazen) is called a Sema. The Sema ritual is a form of Sufi dance and was born out of Rumi’s inspiration. In the Sema, <strong>semazens</strong>, who are also called “<strong>whirling dervishes</strong>,” whirl—not to self-induce a trance, as some believe, but rather to reflect universal truth, that everything in the existence revolves: electrons, moons, planets, entire galaxies; humans live by the circulation of the blood in our bodies, by the cycle of the seasons, and by the stages of our lives; we come from the earth and we return to it.

The program starts with the <strong>classical Turkish music concert</strong> performed by a traditional orchestra for 15 minutes. Then the ceremony starts and lasts about 45 minutes under the amazing lighting and mystic atmosphere of Hodjapasha. Complimentary beverages and Turkish Delight service is available before the performance.

<strong>Larnaca</strong>
Once the ancient capital of Cyprus, Larnaca is rich in history and tradition, with its Medieval and Venetian buildings and the world-famous Tekke mosque. According to legend, it was also visited by Saint Lazarus whose remains are exhibited at the famous church in town. With its secluded beaches and unspoilt Salt Lake, it could not be more ideal for a relaxing day out, all year round. This sleepy seaside town has an ever-growing range of dining options, as more restauranteurs are now choosing to locate away from the commercial “Phinikoudes” seafront. There are countless fish taverns, meze joints and cafes to visit and many are within walking distance.

<strong>Limassol</strong>
Undoubtedly the most cosmopolitan town on the island, Limassol is home to many top-notch eateries of every cuisine. In particular, many high-range hotels have undergone a major revamp and invested in creating new restaurants as glamorous as the local clientele and the guests residing there. Many sophisticated beach bars adorn the coastline, with an array of á la carte options for every palate and around the Medieval castle, a walk into the old quarter reveals many culinary gems. Just outside the town are countless ancient and historical sites, such as Kolossi castle (once the home of Richard the Lionheart), Curium amphitheatre and the ancient city of Amathus.

<strong>Nicosia</strong>
Aside from being the seat of government and the main business centre, the capital city Nicosia is scattered with fantastic places for eating out. The once neglected old quarter of the town has been transformed into a thriving and bustling neighbourhood with small tavernas, cosy bars and coffee shops within its Venetian walls. Many ambitious entrepreneurs have taken the initiative to open up new venues, thus helping the Municipality to revive this beautiful historical centre. It is also home to many museums, art galleries and cultural centres with a busy calendar of events and exhibitions.

<strong>Larnaca</strong>
Once the ancient capital of Cyprus, Larnaca is rich in history and tradition, with its Medieval and Venetian buildings and the world-famous Tekke mosque. According to legend, it was also visited by Saint Lazarus whose remains are exhibited at the famous church in town. With its secluded beaches and unspoilt Salt Lake, it could not be more ideal for a relaxing day out, all year round. This sleepy seaside town has an ever-growing range of dining options, as more restauranteurs are now choosing to locate away from the commercial “Phinikoudes” seafront. There are countless fish taverns, meze joints and cafes to visit and many are within walking distance.

<strong>Limassol</strong>
Undoubtedly the most cosmopolitan town on the island, Limassol is home to many top-notch eateries of every cuisine. In particular, many high-range hotels have undergone a major revamp and invested in creating new restaurants as glamorous as the local clientele and the guests residing there. Many sophisticated beach bars adorn the coastline, with an array of á la carte options for every palate and around the Medieval castle, a walk into the old quarter reveals many culinary gems. Just outside the town are countless ancient and historical sites, such as Kolossi castle (once the home of Richard the Lionheart), Curium amphitheatre and the ancient city of Amathus.

<strong>Nicosia</strong>
Aside from being the seat of government and the main business centre, the capital city Nicosia is scattered with fantastic places for eating out. The once neglected old quarter of the town has been transformed into a thriving and bustling neighbourhood with small tavernas, cosy bars and coffee shops within its Venetian walls. Many ambitious entrepreneurs have taken the initiative to open up new venues, thus helping the Municipality to revive this beautiful historical centre. It is also home to many museums, art galleries and cultural centres with a busy calendar of events and exhibitions.
